# Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project includes a Jupyter Notebook where I explored and analyzed a dataset through data cleaning, basic statistics, and visualizations. The goal was to find useful insights using Python tools like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy.

## File Description

- `Data.ipynb`: The main notebook where the data is cleaned, analyzed, and visualized.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- numpy  

## What’s Covered

- Loading and exploring the dataset  
- Cleaning and preparing the data  
- Creating simple and effective visualizations to understand trends  

## What You’ll See in the Notebook

- How data is imported using `pandas.read_csv()`  
- Summary of the data using `.info()` and `.describe()`  
- How missing values are handled  
- Filtering, grouping, and transforming data  
- Clean and well-organized code for easy understanding  

## Future Improvements

- Add more advanced visualizations like correlation heatmaps or outlier detection  
- Explore relationships in the data with deeper EDA  
- Build basic predictive models to extend the analysis  

## About Me

I'm a data analyst who enjoys exploring data and turning it into clear insights. This notebook shows how I approach real-world data analysis and communicate findings using Python and Jupyter.
