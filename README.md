# 📊 Data Analysis Project

## 📘 Overview

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and visualization. The goal is to derive meaningful insights from the dataset using Python libraries like **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and others.

## 📁 File Structure

- `Data.ipynb`: Main notebook for data exploration, cleaning, and visualization.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

## 📊 Key Highlights

- Data loading and basic statistics
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualizations for better understanding

## 📊 What This Notebook Demonstrates

- Data import using `pandas.read_csv()`
- Summary statistics and structure overview with `.info()` and `.describe()`
- Handling missing data
- Filtering, grouping, and transforming data
- Best practices for writing clean and readable code in Jupyter

## 📌 Future Work

- Add data visualizations using matplotlib/seaborn
- Perform advanced EDA (e.g., correlations, outliers)
- Build simple predictive models

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm a data-driven professional with hands-on experience in **data analysis**, **business insights**, and **Python-based workflows**.  
This project is a reflection of my ability to work with real-world data and communicate insights effectively using notebooks.
